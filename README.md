# revisit-severson-et-al

**NOTE:** Please contact Prof. Richard Braatz, braatz@mit.edu, for access to the code repository associated with the Nature Energy paper (available with an academic license). This respository is unrelated to the Nature Energy paper.

This repository contains code for our work on "voltage arrays" and their dimensionality reduction.

Our key scripts and functions are summarized here:
- `featuregeneration.m`: MATLAB script that generates voltage arrays from the [battery dataset](https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204) and exports them to csvs. 
- `revisit-severson-et-al.ipynb`: Python notebook containing most of the analysis and figure generation.
